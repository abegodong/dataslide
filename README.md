#DataSlide JS

##Description

DataSlide JS is a wordpress plugin & jQuery plugin for slideshow.

##Why?

There are already a lot of slideshow out there, why DataSlide?

Reason #1: I've worked on tons of web development project using Wordpress, and have been on the look out for a perfect slideshow plugin that I can just use, so far, I've settled with vSlider, which is an awesome plugin, but sometime I just have to tweak it and it just not working properly for my purpose.

Reason #2: The second reason is I want to write a tutorial on creating a jQuery and Wordpress plugin, and I think this is a very simple and nice project to start with. So, keep on the lookout for that tutorial, but you can always look at my source code and create one yourself.

Reason #3: For fun, just to learn how to create this simple plugin ... and no, it doesn't take hours to write something like this!

##Requirement
1. jQuery
